Brick-Breaker (mini-game on J2ME)
===============

A Mini J2ME game developed during Undergrad in 2010 for a competition. 
A simple ball-brick breaker game where the ball bounces around the walls and the goal is to target and break the bricks in the area using a bat that the player can control. The most difficult aspect of the game was simulating ball physics (and really basic one at that) and making the game responsive (along with framerate issues) for the user to play smoothly.

The game is targeted for the J2ME platform (MIDP).
